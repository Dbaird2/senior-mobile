Our goal is to provide a seamless way for the school to take inventory of school property. Some of the ways our application will allow for this is by:
- Providing a website that aids in the tasks of auditing, searching,adding and removing inventory, and more!
- The ability to scan asset tags of items using the camera on the user's device
- Logging those items for the inventory check the user is performing
- Letting the user know of any missing items in the room
